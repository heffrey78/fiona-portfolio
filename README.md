# Welcome to Fiona's Digital Playground! 🎨✨

Hey there! I'm Fiona, and this is where my code meets creativity. Dive in and explore my digital world!

## What's Cooking in This Code Kitchen?

- 🌟 A sleek, responsive design that looks great on everything from your phone to your desktop
- 🏠 A cozy home page where you can get to know me and my star projects
- 👩‍💻 An 'About Me' page that's basically my digital coffee date with you
- 💼 A portfolio that's bursting with projects (my digital art gallery, if you will)
- 🎨 A personal work page where I let my imagination run wild
- 📬 A contact form for when you want to chat, collaborate, or just say hi!
- ☁️ Google App Engine ready, because my code likes to live in the cloud

## Tech Ingredients

- Python 3.9+ (because who doesn't love a good snake in their code?)
- Flask and other cool dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Setting Up Your Own Digital Playground

1. Clone this digital wonderland:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/heffrey78/fiona-portfolio.git
   cd fiona-portfolio
   ```

2. Create a cozy virtual environment and step inside:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Invite all the cool packages to the party:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Bringing the Magic to Life

To run this show locally:

```
python app.py
```

Then, head over to `http://localhost:5000` and watch the magic unfold!

## Quality Check

To make sure everything's ship-shape:

```
python -m unittest discover tests
```

## Taking It to the Cloud

Ready to share with the world? Let's deploy to Google App Engine:

1. Make sure you've got the Google Cloud SDK all set up.
2. Wave your wand (or just type these commands):
   ```
   gcloud config set project fiona-site
   gcloud app deploy
   ```
